# Matrix Template Class

This is a template class to work with Matrixes. Any primitive data type (int, float, double, etc) can be used to define a Matrix of any size of rows and columns. 

For Example:

Matrix<int, 3, 3> iMatrix;

Matrix<float, 6, 7> fMatrix;

Matrix<double, 5, 10> dMatrix;

# Supported operations are: 
Matrix addition, substraction, multiplication, traspose, inverse and detrminant, among others.
